      <section>
        <p>SmartLearn ("we", "us", or "our") operates the SmartLearn mobile application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have regarding your information when you use the App.</p>
      </section>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>We collect only the information necessary to provide core app features and improve your learning experience. Types of data we may collect include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> Name, email address, class or grade, profile photo (if you upload one).</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> App interactions such as notes viewed, quizzes taken, and basic analytics needed to monitor performance and improve features.</li>
        <li><strong>Uploaded Content:</strong> Files or images you upload to your profile or to any feature within the App.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>We use the information we collect for purposes such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Providing and maintaining the App and its features (notes, quizzes, profile, notices).</li>
        <li>Personalizing the experience (for example, showing a personalized greeting or saving AI recommendations).</li>
        <li>Analyzing usage to improve the App and fix bugs.</li>
        <li>Delivering AI-generated study recommendations when you use the practice features.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
      <p>Your app data is stored on Firebase Cloud Firestore. We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect your information. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure—please take care when sharing sensitive information.</p>

      <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>The App uses trusted third-party services to operate and enhance functionality. These services may process data as described below:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Firebase (Google):</strong> Used for database/storage and real-time features.</li>
        <li><strong>Generative AI API (Gemini or similar):</strong> Used to generate personalized study recommendations when you request them. AI requests may include non-sensitive usage data and subject labels (e.g., "Algebra, Biology") but do not include unnecessary personal details.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Please review their privacy policies for more details: <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firebase Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

      <h2>5. Children</h2>
      <p>The App is intended for users aged 13 and above. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, please contact us and we will promptly delete the information.</p>

      <h2>6. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
      <p>You have the following rights regarding your personal information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Access & Update:</strong> You can view and update profile information within the App.</li>
        <li><strong>Request Deletion:</strong> You can request deletion of your account or personal data by contacting us at the email below. We will respond and remove data as required by applicable law.</li>
        <li><strong>Uninstall:</strong> You can stop data collection simply by uninstalling the App from your device.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>We retain your information only for as long as necessary to provide the App’s services, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements.</p>

      <h2>8. International Transfers</h2>
      <p>Data collected by the App may be processed and stored in servers located in different countries. By using the App, you consent to transferring, storing, and processing your information in countries outside your own.</p>

      <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. When we do, we will update the "Last updated" date at the top of the policy. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
